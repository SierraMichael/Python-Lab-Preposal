# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Data Analysis of Sales Dataset

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Coding to get meaningful data from a large dataset. The data analysis question for this project: For each product, which fiscal quarter has, on average, the highest amount of sales?


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My code will create plots for four years worth of data and get averages and standard deviations for each quarter during those years.This data will be used to find an average percent of sales for each quarter and answer the analysis question.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I have already coded this project in SAS programming language. However, I want practice doing data analytics in python. I thought recoding in python would give me an oppportunity to check my answers and make sure I'm doing things correctly.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Able to get averages and standard deviations for each quarter, but not group by year.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Able to get averages and standard deviations for each quarter of each year as well as for each quarter overall.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Able to re-code everything I was able to do in SAS; GOOD and BETTER outcomes but be able to visualize the data by graphing.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to practice file reading. A new skill for this project would be learning how to graph data in python.
