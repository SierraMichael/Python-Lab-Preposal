# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

In my SAS class (STAT 3505) I completed a project using a data file from a real world company. I answered the question: For each product, which fiscal quarter has, on average, the highest amount of sales? I want to re-do this project, but do it in python instead and compare. This summer, I have an internship doing data analytics that uses mostly python and want to practice using python for data analytics.

I've attatched the file I would be working with on github.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Just me.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Nope.
